A quickly made implementation of Conway's Game of Life in a competitive setting with pygame  
Each player has bases and a home zone (specifics can be changed in setupConditions.py), they can place alive squares in their homezones and press their button to activate them  
The aim is to deactivate the other player's bases (<half squares in bases alive)  
I am not aware of any bugs but that's what they all say. Although I did try and write this properly despite it being a quick job  
  
This began as a discussion with a friend about https://xkcd.com/696/ which says that Conway's Game of Life has never been turned into a strip game. Thus, naturally, we started talking about how one would make it competitive. I figured out a way how and we agreed that I would make it on the sole condition that she didn't tell me what she did with it because I don't want to know.
